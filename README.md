<h3>How to use our site?</h3>
---
Begin at our beautifully designed login page. You can sign up/ register, and login.

Then you will be taken to a multi-purposed form. This is technically your settings/ search page. Here you can specify certain parameters to limit your search, but note that location is required for the Google Maps API to work.

You also have the ability to save your function for future access.

There are two form buttons, one of which performs a search for a place while the other searches for events.

If you do perform a search, it will render the results page. As you scroll through the list of results, you can choose to add your favorites to your "event list".
